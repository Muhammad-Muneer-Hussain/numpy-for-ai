# NumPy Practice Repository

This repository contains my practice work and exercises using **NumPy** 
completed during my AI training at Samsung Innovation Campus

## 📌 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of numerical 
computing concepts used in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis.

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Creating NumPy arrays
- Indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations
- Broadcasting
- Statistical functions
- Reshaping arrays
- Practice exercises

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook 

## ▶️ How to Run the Code

1. Install Python (if not installed)
2. Install NumPy using:
   pip install numpy PIL
3. Run any file:
   python filename.py

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This practice helped me understand how NumPy is used for fast numerical
computations in AI and Machine Learning workflows.
